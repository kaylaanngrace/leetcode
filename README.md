# Leetcode
A repository filled with leetcode problems. My goal is to improve my problem solving skills and deepen my programming knowledge. 

## Technologies:

JavaScript

## Optimizations

Reading through others solutions and editorials on leetcode, along with reading the MDN helps me refactor my own solutions. In doing so, it helps improve/strengthen my understanding of complexity and key concepts. 

## Lessons Learned:

The most valualbe lesson I've learned is there are mutiple approaches to solving a problem. There is a constant demand for improvement and learning as a programmer and no matter how skilled or experienced you are, you can always learn more. As well an algorithm may be popular and short in terms of lines written but there may be a less commonly known solution that improves the code's complexity tremendously. The best way to improve is through practice and repetition.
